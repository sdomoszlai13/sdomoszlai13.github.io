Hello and welcome to my blog! You can find posts about a selection of my projects below.

# The that-looks-exciting-let's-explore-it blog

Whenever I find something exciting in the world of software development, I usually create a small project to try it out. The result of these explorations are summarized in the blog posts about projects below. There are also some introductory blog posts to tools or concepts I considered worth sharing.

As a passionate software developer, physicist, and microelectronics geek, I'm constantly looking to combine interesting and useful achievments of these fields in new ways. Lean back, relax and enjoy some brain gymnastics!

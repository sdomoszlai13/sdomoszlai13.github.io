# A gentle introduction to Machine Learning - Predicting Real Estate Prices

If you're lucky, at some point in your life, you get the chance to purchase a property or even a house. However, here begins a painful journey of looking for your dream home and being shocked when taking a look at the price tag. When an acceptable and affordable home has been found despite the difficulties, there's still one important question: Is the price fair? If you ask the owner, it sure is. Now imagine there's a software that tells you just that. This answer is absolutely data-based and fairly objective. To do this, it's best to train a machine learning model.

{% include info.html text="<b>Machine learning, eh? So machines now go to school too?</b><br> Not exactly. Machine learning refers to a method in computer science that takes a specific piece of software called a 'model', and a data set called 'training dataset' and computes a lot of values called 'weights' used in the model to fit the training dataset. After this step, we say that the model is 'trained' and given a dataset similar to the training dataset, it can make predictions for our previously specified values of interest called 'target values'. Though not entirely accurate, in short we can say that the process of machine learning is pattern recognition in given data. This process is similar to the way humans look at a bunch of numbers and try to figure out the defining rule or pattern." %}

Suppose you'd like to purchase a house in Ames, Iowa. It just so happens that there's a great collection of housing data just for this place called the Ames Housing dataset. This dataset is a collection of almost 3,000 sold properties with up to 80 attributes recorded for each transaction. Thus, we barely need a way to train a machine learning model to 'guess' the prices of the sold properties correctly so it can give a reasonable price estimate for our dream home.

Nowadays, the most popular language used to work with machine learning models is **Python**. Python has a lot of great modules and libraries specifically developed for this and is really easy to use. The Python module **scikit-learn** is a comprehensive collection of different machine learning models. We'll train a few models and combine their estimates to get an even better result. First, we're gonna visualize the training data to get a feel for this particular data set. A few corrections to unrealistic or non-representative data points called outliers usually also need to be done at this point. Next, we'll train the models using the training set. This step can be repeated when specific parameters of the models called 'hyperparameters' were tweaked to yield better results. However, for the sake of simplicity and as a combination of models is used to make predictions, this step will be skipped in this tutorial. In the last step, 
we're gonna let the models make predictions on housing data they've never seen before but for which the 'right solution' (real sale price) is available to us. This way, we can evaluate the performance of our trained models.

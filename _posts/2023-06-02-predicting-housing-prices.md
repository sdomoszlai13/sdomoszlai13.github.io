# Introduction to Machine Learning - Predicting Real Estate Prices

If you're lucky, at some point in your life, you get the chance to purchase a property or even a house. However, here begins a painful journey of looking for your dream home and being shocked when taking a look at the price tag. When an acceptable and affordable home has been found despite the difficulties, there's still one important question: Is the price fair? If you ask the owner, it sure is. Now imagine there's a software that tells you just that. This answer is absolutely data-based and fairly objective. To do this, it's best to train a machine learning model.

*Machine learning, eh? So machines go to school now?* <br>
Not exactly. Machine learning refers to a method in computer science that takes a specific piece of software called a 'model', and a data set called 'training set' and computes a lot of values called 'weights' used in the model to fit the training set. After this step, we say that the model is 'trained' and given a data set similar to the training set, it can make predictions for our previously specified values of intereset called 'target values'. Though not entirely accurate, in short we can say that the process of machine learning is pattern recognition in given data. This process is similar to the way humans look at a bunch of numbers and try to figure out the defining rule or pattern.

# Simple Arduino-based Weather Station

See also: why buy a professional weather station for 30$ if you can build your own for 40$, although with less functionality and more frustration?

The screen of the lovely weather station with a backlit sun and clouds, purchased a few weeks ago from Aliexpress for 15$, reads (as ever so often): "Indoor temperature: 20.6 C, indoor humidity: 56%. Outdoor temperature: -.-- C, outdoor humidty: --%".
This journey begins on a Tuesday morning as I am looking at our certainly cute but not too reliable weather station. The base station lost connection to the outdoor unit - again. "Why not build your own then?", I said to myself, and so I did.

I wanted to build a weather station similar to those available commercially. The system consists of a base station that can be put on a shelf or table indoor and a remote unit that can be placed outdoor, though it should not come in direct contact with water. Both units measure temperature, pressure and humidity. The remote unit transmits the data to the base station that displays both indoor and outdoor measurements. The remote unit features a display too, which is off by default and displays current measurement values for a few seconds when the button on the unit is pressed. The display of the base station is always on.

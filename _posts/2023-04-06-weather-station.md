# Simple Arduino-based Weather Station

See also: why buy a professional weather station for 30$ if you can build your own for 40$, although with less functionality and more frustration?

The screen of the lovely weather station with a backlit sun and clouds, purchased a few weeks ago from Aliexpress for 15$, reads (as ever so often): "Indoor temperature: 20.6 C, indoor humidity: 56%. Outdoor temperature: -.-- C, outdoor humidty: --%".
This journey begins on a Tuesday morning as I am looking at our certainly cute but not too reliable weather station. The base station lost connection to the outdoor unit - again. "Why not build your own then?", I said to myself, and so I did.

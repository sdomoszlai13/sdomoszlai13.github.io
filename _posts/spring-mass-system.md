#Spring Mass System Simulation

In this post we'll be looking at a simulation of a system of fixtures, masses, and springs in two dimensions. Fixtures and masses can be set up with initial coordinates and initial velocities (not for fixtures, of course). After setting the desired temporal length and the number of time steps, the simulation is run and a plot is created with the fixtures, masses, and the masses' trajectories. There's also an option to save the trajectories to a file.
